2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - The type of issue (e.g., XSS, CSRF, RCE).

We generally only support the latest version of the software. If a security vulnerability is reported, we will patch:
- The latest release (`main` branch).

Older versions may not be maintained unless explicitly stated.

## Public Disclosure

After a fix is released, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability details in:

- A changelog or release notes.

If you wish to be credited for your responsible disclosure, let us know when reporting.
